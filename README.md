# Personal Productivity Automation Toolkit

A collection of simple Python automation tools to make daily work more efficient.  
This project focuses on core Python skills: file handling, CLI design, data processing, and basic persistence (CSV/JSON).

## Tools Included

1. **File Organizer**
   - Organizes files in a folder into subfolders by extension (e.g. `Images/`, `Documents/`, `Code/`).

2. **Notes → To-Do Extractor**
   - Reads a `.txt` notes file and extracts to-do items into a separate checklist file.

3. **Simple Time Tracker**
   - Start/stop tracking tasks from the command line and store logs in a CSV file.

python main.py
